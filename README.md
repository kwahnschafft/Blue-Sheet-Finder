### Purpose of the project

We have created a piece of software that helps students identify potential grammatical errors (or Blue Sheets, as our school calls them).
Students can upload an essay that they have written and can select a common grammatical mistake for the program to search for in their
essay. Once these potential errors are found, students can go through and correct their mistakes or deem them already correct. Finally,
students can export their improved essay, now more confident in its grammatical correctness!
